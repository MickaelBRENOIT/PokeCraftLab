## Setting up Theme

### SplashScreen

The logo was created thanks to DALL-E 3.<br/>
Prompt used: *Create a logo featuring the head of a fluffy, fictional creature inspired by Pokemon. The creature should be smiling warmly, with a friendly and inviting expression. Its fur should appear soft and fluffy, giving it a cute and approachable look. The logo should be designed with a transparent background, making it suitable for various applications. The image should be centered and well-balanced, ensuring that the creature's head is the focal point of the logo. The style should be clean and simplistic, suitable for a professional logo design.*

Then I followed the UI Guide from Android documentation [Splashscreen](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/launch/splash-screen).<br/>
I used [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) to create my centered backgroundless logo: *App icon without an icon background: this must be 288Ã—288 dp and fit within a circle 192 dp in diameter.*<br/>
Note 1 :warning:: Export to SVG put an **image** tag, whereas we want **path** tags to draw our logo. Use [Convert PNG to SGV](https://png2svg.com/)<br/>
Note 2 :warning:: I tried to animate my icon with [shapeshifter](https://shapeshifter.design/) but it's not working... (Well preview is working in the tool but not Android Studio (bug ?))

### App icon

1. Right-click on "res" folder
2. Choose "Icon type: Launcher Icons (Adaptive and Legacy)"
3. On Foreground Layer upload an Asset type of image. Resize if necessary
4. On BAckground Layer choose the predominant color of uploaded image 

### Font

1. Right-click on "res" folder and new "Android Resource Directory"
2. Choose Font
3. Search a [font](https://fonts.google.com/) and download it. Rename files with lowercase and underscore.
4. Modify "Type.kt" following [MD3](https://m3.material.io/styles/typography/overview) guidelines.

### Theme

1. Go on [MD3 Builder](https://m3.material.io/theme-builder#/custom) and choose a primary, secondary and tertiary colors.
2. Take your app icon and go to [imageresizer](https://imageresizer.com/color-picker) for example and extract colors.
3. Once colors have been chosen, download files and update "Color.kt" and "Theme.kt" in your app.

In "Theme.kt" you can update your status and navigation colors

```kotlin

    val window = (view.context as Activity).window
    window.statusBarColor = colorScheme.background.toArgb()
    window.navigationBarColor = colorScheme.background.toArgb()

```

## Dependency Injection

We will use Dagger Hilt for [Dependency Injection (DI)](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android?hl=fr) as recommended by Google.

1. Add dependencies to "build.gradle" at project level
2. Add dependencies to "build.gradle" at app module level and add references to dagger-hilt plugin.
3. Update "sourceCompatibility" and "targetCompatibility" to JavaVersion 1.8 according to the official documentation. But it seems since AGP verion 8.0.0, the targeted JavaVersion is 17.
4. Create a class extending Application and add this class to the *application* tag in manifest file. (*android:name* attribute). This file should be annoted with **@AndroidHiltApp**
5. Finally, *MainActivity* should be annoted with *@AndroidEntryPoint*.

## Firebase

In this project we will use [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for our [authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth?authuser=0) & [remote database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore?authuser=0).<br/>
So we need to:
1. Create a project
2. Add an Android application
3. Specify our app's package name
4. Give our debug's sha1. Execute gradle task named *signingReport* at projet's level tasks and Android Debug Keys will appear in terminal
5. *google-services.json* will be generated. This file should be placed in *app* root folder.
6. Edit *project/build.gradle* and *app/build.gradle* with Firebase dependencies. A BOM is available for tracking the last version
7. Finally, add dependencies following what tools from Firebase you're using (authentication, firestore, ...)

Note :warning:: Don't forget to add *google-services.json* file to the *.gitignore* file to avoid pushing on remote server.
